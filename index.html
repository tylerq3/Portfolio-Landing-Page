      <li>Job Experience</li>
      <p>Some of the jobs I have had are the post office, pizza hut and currently I work as a service advisor. All of these jobs have made my communication skills improve tremendously.</p>
      <li>Epicodus</li>
      <p>Why I joined epicodus was because I wanted to get into tech and have the ability to work remotely.</p>
      <li>Sports</li>
      <p>Sports have made me the man I am today. The two sports I love the most and played football and basketball. I have played these sports since I was a kid, and I think they are very important, they instill hard work, competitiveness and the ability to work in a team. </p>
      <li>Gaming and the Gym</li>
      <p>Playing video games and working out have always been the best release and escape from reality for me. When I'm doing either I always have a good time and all my worries seem to go away as long as I'm doing them.</p>
      <li>Cars</li>
      <p>Since I was a kid, my dad and I have always shared the same passion for cars. We've watched tons of car movies and have bought cars that we have always dreamt of owning.</p>
