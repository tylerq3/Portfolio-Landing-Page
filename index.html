        <li>Sports</li>
        <p>Sports have made me the man I am today. The two sports I love the most and played football and basketball. I have played these sports since I was a kid, and I think they are very important, they instill hard work, competitiveness and the ability to work in a team. </p>

        <p>Playing video games and working out have always been the best release and escape from reality for me. When I'm doing either I always have a good time and all my worries seem to go away as long as I'm doing them.</p>
